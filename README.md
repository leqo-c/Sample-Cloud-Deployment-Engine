# Sample-Cloud-Deployment-Engine
An implementation of a simple cloud deployment engine in C# that uses event-driven programming. The application consists of:

· A Cloud deployment engine, who is given YAML specifications representing the services that need to be deployed;

· A Cloud provider, that handles the creation and the destruction of the services the engine needs to deploy;

· A Recursive descent parser that parses YAML specifications
